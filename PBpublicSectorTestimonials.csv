Overtime,"Clemson University reduced overpaid overtime by 40% and can now track employee time by pay period, improving compliance with FLSA regulations. Employees are paid through the PeopleSoft solution, and the university exports exceptions via Kronos for its nonexempt salaried employees every two weeks. A second payroll export was created for the 21-day schedule of fire and EMS staff. For both hourly and nonexempt salaried employees, the Kronos solution captures actual hours worked, leave time, overtime, and comp time earned. ","Kronos helped DeKalb County improve its bottom line. ""Workforce Timekeeper helped us notice a discrepancy in the way some employees were filling out overtime on their timesheets,"" the Lead Programmer Analyst states. ""As a result, we were able to identify many 15-minute increments that weren't really overtime; this helped us save a significant amount of money.""","Kronos helped DeKalb County improve its bottom line.

By deploying Kronos and applying overtime rules
uniformly across the organization, the university eliminated $702,000 in annual overtime costs.","Kronos helped DeKalb County improve its bottom line.

Payroll Inflation,"With hourly employees now clocking in and out at biometric time clocks at the beginning and end of the day and at lunch, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools has an accurate record of each employee’s time. Suspected time abuse from buddy punching and badge swiping is no longer a concern.  “Now we have a better comfort level as far as paying employees for what they have worked,” says Mike Martin, director of payroll. “And any prior FLSA concerns about paying employees accurately are no longer an issue.”","The City and County of Denver reduced payroll staff from 80 to 35, with impacted employees moving to open, unfilled positions or choosing to retire. The reduction of 45 full-time equivalents has resulted in $1.5 million in yearly labor cost savings.  Looking ahead, the organization sees further savings. “We anticipate an ROI of $5.2 million over the next five years related to our Kronos implementation,” claims a payroll manager, “and an additional savings of $1.1 million per year in cost avoidance.” ","The City and County of Denver reduced payroll staff from 80 to 35, with impacted employees moving to open, unfilled positions or choosing to retire.

Leave Inflation,"A payroll associate at Union Public Schools said “Tracking comp time balances and calculating overtime were two of our biggest challenges in payroll prior to Kronos. Now, we can see if employees are taking overtime or comp time, and calculations in the Kronos system are consistently accurate.”","The City of Orlando was able to eliminate redundant data entries and accurately track the hours that employees worked, whether they were full-time, seasonal, or temporarily hired for a single event. The Kronos solution enabled the city to automate all its manual processes to improve services. Overtime allocation has been significantly improved, too, and the city has saved money by eliminating multiple or redundant positions.","The City of Orlando was able to eliminate redundant data entries and accurately track the hours that employees worked, whether they were full-time, seasonal, or temporarily hired for a single event.

Overtime allocation has been significantly improved, too, and the city has saved money by eliminating multiple or redundant positions.","Within the first year of implementing their Kronos solution, Monmouth Universityexperienced numerous improvements. First, Monmouth designated four timekeepers for administrators, staff, police, and facilities management personnel groups. This helps Monmouth enforce policies on overtime, leave, PTO, and attendance. As a result, managers can focus on more strategic initiatives. ""Employees are now responsible for monitoring their own time,"" Maureen Coffey says.","The City of Orlando was able to eliminate redundant data entries and accurately track the hours that employees worked, whether they were full-time, seasonal, or temporarily hired for a single event.

Calc Error,"By replacing timesheets with time clocks and carefully programming rounding rules, Broward County Public Schools reduced its total annual payroll for substitute teachers by 4 percent.  A major state-run university used Kronos to reduce payroll error by 93 percent.  A payroll associate at Union Public Schools said “The reduction in paperwork is huge without timesheets. Going to an automated system gives us a clear and accurate picture of the time worked by each employee.”","A user at a city government in Ohio said, “Our payroll error is significantly lower, although we haven’t calculated it. Before the deployment, managers in each department interpreted pay rules their own way and were sometimes generous on a selective basis. Eliminating this is definitely saving money.”","A user at a city government in Ohio said, “Our payroll error is significantly lower, although we haven’t calculated it.
